      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Many of us have way more games on Steam than we actually play regularly. If at all.</p>
      <p>SteamHour is a tool that helps you see what games you've played at least 60 minutes of — an arbitrary limit,
        perhaps but a useful one. For most games, an hour is the bare minimum you need to really get into the game and
        start to understand the mechanics.</p>
      <p>SteamHour was designed to help me in a project based on this idea. I realized I had a LOT of 0-minute games in
        my library and I felt like I wanted to remedy this. I began working through my library, playing at least 60
        minutes of each game.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, you'll find it useful too — or at least amusing =)</p>
